This Neovim plugin provides an asynchronous interface to run project-wide TypeScript type-checking using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). It displays the type-checking results in a quickfix list and provides visual notifications about the progress and completion of type-checking.

## Features

- Project-wide type checking
- Asynchronous execution of the TypeScript compiler to prevent lock ups and input lag
- Progress notifications with spinner animation
- Quickfix list for navigating errors
- Automatic opening of the quickfix list if there are errors
- User-friendly command `:TSC`

## Installation

To install the plugin, use your preferred Neovim plugin manager.

### Packer

To install the plugin using packer.nvim, add the following to your plugin configuration:

```lua
use('dmmulroy/tsc.nvim')

```

### Vim-Plug

To install the plugin using vim-plug, add the following to your plugin configuration:

```vim
Plug 'dmmulroy/tsc.nvim'
```

Then run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugin.

### Notify

For an enhanced UI/UX experience, it is recommended to install the [nvim_notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify) plugin as well. This plugin is optional, and the plugin will work without it.

## Setup

To set up the plugin, add the following line to your `init.vim` or `init.lua` file:

```lua
require('tsc').setup()
```

## Usage

To run TypeScript type-checking, execute the `:TSC` command in Neovim. The plugin will display a progress notification while the type-checking is in progress. When the type-checking is complete, it will show a notification with the results and open a quickfix list if there are any errors.

If `watch` mode is enabled, tsc.nvim will automatically run in the background every time you save in a typescript or tsx file and report the results back to you. In addition, if `auto_start_watch_mode` is enabled, the `:TSC` command will be executed on your behalf when you enter a typescript or tsx files.

## Configuration

By default, the plugin uses the default `tsc` command with the `--noEmit` flag to avoid generating output files during type-checking. It also emulates the default tsc behavior of performing a backward search from the current directory for a `tsconfig` file. The flags option can accept both a string and a table. Here's the default configuration:

```lua
{
  auto_open_qflist = true,
  auto_close_qflist = false,
  auto_focus_qflist = false,
  auto_start_watch_mode = false,
  bin_path = utils.find_tsc_bin(),
  enable_progress_notifications = true,
  flags = {
    noEmit = true,
    project = function()
      return utils.find_nearest_tsconfig()
    end,
    watch = false,
  },
  hide_progress_notifications_from_history = true,
  spinner = { "⣾", "⣽", "⣻", "⢿", "⡿", "⣟", "⣯", "⣷" },
  pretty_errors = true,
}
```

With this configuration, you can use keys for flag names and their corresponding values to enable/disable the flag (in the case of `noEmit = true`), provide a function (as in the case of the `project`) or enable watch mode. This makes the configuration more explicit and easier to read. Additionally, the flags option is backwards compatible and can accept a string value if you prefer a simpler configuration:

```lua
flags = "--noEmit",
```

## FAQs

### I'm using `nvim-notify` and being spammed by progress notifications, what's going on?

It's likely that the overwritten default `vim.notify` function isn't returning `nvim-notify`'s notification record, which is used to replace the existing notification. Make sure that you're nvim-notify configuration looks something like this:

```lua
local notify = require('notify')

vim.notify = function(message, level, opts)
  return notify(message, level, opts) -- <-- Important to return the value from `nvim-notify`
end

```

### Why doesn't tsc.nvim typecheck my entire monorepo?

In a monorepo setup, tsc.nvim only typechecks the project associated with the nearest `tsconfig.json` by default. If you need to typecheck across all projects in the monorepo, you must change the flags configuration option in the setup function to include `--build`. The `--build` flag instructs TypeScript to typecheck all referenced projects, taking into account project references and incremental builds for better management of dependencies and build performance. Your adjusted setup function should look like this:

```lua
require('tsc').setup({
  flags = {
    build = true,
  },
})
```

With this configuration, tsc.nvim will typecheck all projects in the monorepo, taking into account project references and incremental builds.
